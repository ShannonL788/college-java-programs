# CompareStrings

## Problem

Write a Java program that compares two Strings. The two Strings should be inputted using user input.  
(i) If the two Strings are exactly the same, a message should be 
printed to the screen which reads "Exactly the same: True",  
otherwise, a message should be printed to the screen which reads 
"Exactly the same: False".  <br>
(ii) If and only if the first comparison was false, a comparison 
should be done that ignores case sensitivity. If they are the same, 
while ignoring the case, a message should be printed to the 
screen which reads "Similar: True", otherwise, a message should 
be printed to the screen which reads "Similar: False".  <br>
