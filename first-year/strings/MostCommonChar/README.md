Write a Java program that asks the user to input a String. The program should then determine which character occurs most frequently in the String and how many times it occurs. Your program should ignore blank spaces and only worry about other characters.

### Sample Input

### Sample Output 

The most common character is: t <br>
t occurs 6 times
