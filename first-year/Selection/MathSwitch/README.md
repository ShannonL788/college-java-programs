# MathSwitch

## Problem

Write a program that initialises two variables to store whole numbers and a variable to store a single character. This character should be either '+', '-', '/' or '*'. The program should check the character using a switch and perform the appropriate arithmetic. That is, if the character is '+' then the result of the two numbers added together should be printed to the screen
