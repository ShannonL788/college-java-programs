# CircleAreaCircum

## Problem

Write a program that asks the user to input two numbers. The first number should be a number representing the radius of a circle. The second number entered should be either 1 or 2. If the second number inputted is 1 the program should calculate the area of a circle with the inputted radius or if the second number entered is 2 the program should calculate the circumference of a circle with the inputted radius.<br> 
The area of a circle is calculated as :𝜋𝑟^2 and the circumference of a circle as: 𝜋𝑑 where 𝜋 = 3.14159 , r represents the first number inputted and d is the diameter of the circle.
