# Random2DArray

## Problem

Write a Java program that performs the following steps: <br>
- Declares a two-dimensional array (of type double) 
called randData of size 3 x 3. <br>
- Use a nested for loop or while loop to generate a random 
number between 0 and 100.  <br>
- Each element in the randData array is assigned a 
random number value.  <br>
- The code shall print out every random number value 
generated for this array. <br>
